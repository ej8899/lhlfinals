Here's the mid-term "resource wall" idea for reference and as a starting point.

Option 7: Resource Wall
Pinterest for learners.

Allow learners to save learning resources like tutorials, blogs and videos in a central place that is publicly available to any user.

Requirements:
users should be able to save an external URL along with a title and description
users should be able to search for already-saved resources created by any user
users should be able to categorize any resource under a topic
users should be able to comment on any resource
users should be able to rate any resource
users should be able to like any resource
users should be able to view all their own and all liked resources on one page ("My resources")
users should be able to register, log in, log out and update their profile

Additional:
users should be able to build a 'lesson plan' of videos and share this lesson plan with others
lesson plans should have a 'check list' of studied vs not studied videos
resource items (videos) should have a 'watch later' icon so the user can quickly see what they added to a watch later list
