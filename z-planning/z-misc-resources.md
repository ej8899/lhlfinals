# GIT commit formats
A structure with git commit messages that I started using a while back - you're free to use this format to stay consistent throughout the project, or use your own.  If you have a different consistent format, feel free to suggest it!

fix: (bug fix)
feat: (new feature)
chore: (normal maintenance)
refactor: (cleanup of code)
ci:  (continuous improvement/development)
docs: work on documentation
admin: docs or files in an admin/private directory

can also use with (WIP) for work in progress and (FIN) for finished

example:

feat: add sign in form (WIP)
feat: add sign in form (FIN)
