## Getting Started
Clone the repository to your computer.
You'll also need the server and SQL data that is available within this same github repository.

## SERVER Getting Started
1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information 
  - username: `development` 
  - password: `development` 
  - database: `finals`
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Create database finals using 
  - `psql -U development`
  - `create databaase finals;`
5. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
6. Create account in `screenshotapi.net` and get the `API KEY`
7. Add TOKEN=`API KEY` in .env. See `.env.example`
8. Run the server without nodemon: `npm start`
9. Run the server with nodemon: `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
